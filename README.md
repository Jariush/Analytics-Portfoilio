# Jarius Hamid Analytics Portfolio
## About Me!

Hello! My name is Jarius and I am a Master’s in Analytics graduate from Florida Gulf Coast University, with a bachelors degree in Economics. I have a deep passion for research and data analysis. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have applied statistical techniques, modeling, data processing, and visualization to projects such as assessing diabetes risk factors and exploring the correlation between poverty and crime. 

I also have experience as a data analyst intern at LeeTran. I leverage my skills in data analysis, predictive modeling, and geospatial analysis to optimize transit operations, improve reporting workflows, and support key transportation planning initiatives aimed at enhancing efficiency and performance.

Below are some fo the projects I have worked on!

## Projects

### Forecasting Ridership
**Linear Regression Code:** [Ridership Analysis](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/blob/main/Ridership%20Forecasting/Forecasting%20Ridership%20lm.R) 

**Visualizations:** [Ridership Visualization](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/blob/main/Ridership%20Forecasting/Visualizations.pdf)

**Goal:** Create a ridership forecast model to predict weekly ridership based on historical data and seasonal effects.

**Skills:** data visualization, linear regression, visualizations

**Technology/Libraries:** ggplot, lm, lubridate, dplyr, tidyr

**Results:** The R analysis provides a predicted forecast for the selected weeks.

### Transit Accesibility Analysis
**Regression Analysis:** [Cross Sectional Analysis](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/blob/main/Regression%20Project/Census-Project.pdf) 

**Census Tract Visualizations:** [Ridership Visualization](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/blob/main/Regression%20Project/Census-Data-Visuals.pdf)

**Research Paper:** [Full Research Paper](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/blob/main/Regression%20Project/Hamid_LeeTran%20Case%20Study.pdf)

**Goal:** Access to transit has a significant impact on local communities as highlighted in the existing literature.
Public transit is particularly crucial in serving underprivileged communities, where on-time
performance (OTP) plays a vital role in ensuring reliable service and access. This analysis serves two
main purposes. First, it provides a daily overview of LeeTran’s route performance and offers suggestions
for improvement. Second, it examines how socio-economic factors, such as median household
income, are key determinants in deciding where to place bus stops. Using data analysis and regression
modeling, I examine dailyOTP at LeeTran and perform a cross-sectional analysis to explore how
socio-economic factors, particularly median household income, influence transit access and steer bus
stop placement toward low-income communities. Finally, I will propose potential solutions and policy
recommendations for LeeTran to enhance its operations moving forward.

**Skills:** data visualization, linear regression, cross-sectional analysis, R, transit analysis

**Technology/Libraries:** R(ggplot, lm, lubridate, dplyr, tidyr, grid, psych. etc)

**Results:** The R analysis provides a predicted forecast for the selected weeks.
