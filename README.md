## About Me!

Hello! My name is Jarius and I am a Masterâ€™s in Analytics graduate from Florida Gulf Coast University, with a bachelors degree in Economics. I have a deep passion for research and data analysis. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have applied statistical techniques, modeling, data processing, and visualization to projects such as assessing diabetes risk factors and exploring the correlation between poverty and crime. 

I also have experience as a data analyst intern at LeeTran. I leverage my skills in data analysis, predictive modeling, and geospatial analysis to optimize transit operations, improve reporting workflows, and support key transportation planning initiatives aimed at enhancing efficiency and performance.

Below are some fo the projects I have worked on!

## Projects

### Forecasting Ridership
**Linear Regression Code:** [Ridership Analysis](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/blob/main/Ridership%20Forecasting/Forecasting%20Ridership%20lm.R) 

**Visualizations:** [Ridership Visualization](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/blob/main/Ridership%20Forecasting/Visualizations.pdf)

**Goal:** Create a ridership forecast model to predict weekly ridership based on historical data and seasonal effects.

**Skills:** data visualization, linear regression, visualizations

**Technology/Libraries:** ggplot, lm, lubridate, dplyr, tidyr

**Results:** The R analysis provides a predicted forecast for the selected weeks.

### Transit Accesibility Analysis
**Regression Analysis:** [Cross Sectional Analysis](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/blob/main/Regression%20Project/Census-Project.pdf) 
**Census Tract Visualizations:** [Ridership Visualization](https://github.com/Jariush/Analytics-Portfoilio/blob/main/Regression%20Project/Census-Data-Visuals.pdf)
